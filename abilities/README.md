# pAI-OS Abilities

The Personal Artificial Intelligence Operating System (pAI-OS) abilities directory is a library of modular components, known as "abilities," which extend the core functionality of pAI-OS. Each ability is housed in its own directory and serves a specific purpose, from data storage solutions to protocol support and advanced AI integrations.

## Overview

Abilities in paios are akin to plugins in WordPress. They are designed to be easily integrated into the core system to provide additional features and capabilities. They range from foundational utilities like vector and relational storage handlers to cutting-edge functionalities such as Solid protocol integration, optical character recognition (OCR), Retrieve-Augment-Generate (RAG) orchestration, and large language model (LLM) interfaces.

## Structure

In this `abilities` folder, you'll find a collection of subdirectories, each named after the ability it represents (for example, `pgsql` for PostgreSQL support or `openai` for OpenAI's API integration). Within each subdirectory, the ability is fully contained, including all necessary code, documentation, and configurations needed for pAI-OS to utilize it.

## Getting Started

To use an ability, you should first navigate to its respective directory. There you will find a dedicated README.md file with detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and use the ability within your instance of pAI-OS.

### Installation

Each ability typically includes an `install` script or an installation guide with instructions on integrating it with pAI-OS. The general steps to install an ability are as follows:

1. Clone the paios repository.
2. Navigate to the `abilities` directory: `cd abilities/`
3. Enter the directory of the desired ability: `cd <ability_name>/`
4. Follow the installation instructions specific to the ability.

### Configuration

Many abilities will require some form of configuration to function correctly. This may include setting environment variables, editing configuration files, or providing necessary API keys. Specific configuration guidelines are provided within each ability's directory.

### Usage

After installation and configuration, the ability can be utilized as part of the pAI-OS. Detailed usage instructions will be provided in the ability-specific README.md.

## Available Abilities

Here are some examples of abilities we expect to be made available within pAI-OS:

- `pgsql` - Adds PostgreSQL relational storage capability.
- `openai` - Integrates with OpenAI's API for LLM features.
- `chromadb` - Provides efficient vector data storage solutions.
- `solid` - Supports interoperability with Solid protocol.
- `ocr` - Implements optical character recognition tools.
- `rag_orchestration` - Manages RAG orchestration for efficient task management.

_Note: This list will grow as more abilities are developed and added to the repository._

## Contributing

pAI-OS thrives on community contributions. If you have created an ability that you believe would benefit the pAI-OS community, please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to submit your ability for inclusion in this directory.

# Personal Artificial Intelligence Operating System (pAI-OS)

## Getting Started

|❗ The server binds to localhost without authentication for the time being; this is a security issue that will be fixed before release to end users. You can use any username and password for the time being.|
|--|

### Users

An easy to use release is coming soon, but for now you can follow the instructions below to get started.

### Early Adopters

> 💡 **Tip:** Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you can't run it from the terminal.

Open the Terminal application.

Clone the canary branch from the repository:

```sh
git clone --branch canary --single-branch https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios.git
```

Setup and run the server:

# Alembic

Alembic is used to manage database versioning using migrations.

## Upgrade schema

`alembic upgrade head`

## Downgrade schema

`alembic downgrade -1`

## Update schema

Update backend/models.py then run:

`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "added asset table"`

** NOTE: If you get an error about an already existing table, you can drop the table and run 'alembic upgrade head' again. This is a known issue for the user and the public_key_cred tables. **

_POSIX (Linux/macOS/etc.)_

```sh
python3 paios/scripts/setup_environment.py (only on first run)
source paios/.venv/bin/activate
python3 -m paios
```

_Windows_

```sh
python .\paios\scripts\setup_environment.py (only on first run)
.\paios\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

### Developers

Clone the entire repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios.git
```

> 🤖 **Tip:** Early Adopters don't need to build the frontend on the canary branch because it's done automatically on every commit to main.

Build the frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
```

Run the uvicorn server:

```sh
python -m paios
```

# Personal Artificial Intelligence Operating System (pAI-OS)

## Getting Started

### Users

An easy to use release is coming soon, but for now you can follow the instructions below to get started.

### Early Adopters

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you can't run it from the terminal.

Open the Terminal application.

Clone the canary branch from the repository:

```sh
git clone --branch canary --single-branch https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios.git
```

Setup and run the server:

# Alembic

Alembic is used to manage database versioning using migrations.

## Upgrade schema

`alembic upgrade head`

## Downgrade schema

`alembic downgrade -1`

## Update schema

Update backend/models.py then run:

`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "added collection table"`

** NOTE: If you get an error about an already existing table, you may want to drop the table and run 'alembic upgrade head' again. **

### Developers

Clone the entire repository

```sh

> ðŸ¤– **Tip:** Early Adopters don't need to build the frontend on the canary branch because it's done automatically on every commit to main.

```sh
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
```

Run the uvicorn server:

```sh
python -m paios
```
